{"id":"opensprint.dev-9juz","title":"Fix: bd daemon processes leak and accumulate across backend restarts","description":"## Problem\n\nThe `BeadsService.startDaemonIfNeeded()` method in `packages/backend/src/services/beads.service.ts` spawns `bd daemon start` processes that accumulate over time and are never cleaned up. On 2026-02-18 we found **2,600+ leaked bd daemon processes** consuming system resources.\n\n### Evidence\n\nActivity Monitor showed ~2,600 processes of two types:\n- `bd daemon start` (~1,470 instances)\n- `bd daemon --start --interval 5s` (~1,140 instances)\n\nAll were orphaned to PID 1 (launchd). They were actively respawning — after killing all of them, dozens reappeared within seconds from the running backend dev server(s).\n\n### Root Cause\n\n1. **In-memory-only deduplication cache is lost on restart.** The `daemonReady` Map (line 14) only lives in the Node process. When `tsx watch` restarts the backend (on file change or crash), the cache is lost. The new process calls `ensureDaemon()` → `bd daemon start`, spawning a new daemon even though old ones are still running.\n\n2. **`bd daemon start` doesn't reliably detect existing daemons.** The `isDaemonPidAlive()` check (line 66) reads `.beads/daemon.pid`, but this PID file may be stale or reference only one of many running daemons. The `bd daemon status --json` check (line 83) also appears unreliable, as evidenced by the massive accumulation.\n\n3. **Multiple dev server instances compound the problem.** During the incident, 3 separate `npm run dev` stacks were running from the same codebase (started at different times), each with its own backend. Each backend independently spawned daemons.\n\n4. **No cleanup on backend shutdown.** When the Node backend exits (intentionally or via crash), it does not stop bd daemons it started.\n\n### Fix Required\n\n**A) Run `bd daemon stop` before `bd daemon start`** — In `startDaemonIfNeeded()`, always attempt to stop any existing daemon before starting a new one. This prevents accumulation.\n\n```typescript\nprivate async startDaemonIfNeeded(repoPath: string): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e {\n  if (this.isDaemonPidAlive(repoPath)) return;\n\n  // Stop any potentially stale daemon before starting fresh\n  try {\n    await execAsync(\"bd daemon stop\", { cwd: repoPath, timeout: 5_000, env: { ...process.env } });\n  } catch { /* ignore — may not be running */ }\n\n  try {\n    await execAsync(\"bd daemon start\", { cwd: repoPath, timeout: 10_000, env: { ...process.env } });\n  } catch (err: unknown) {\n    // ... existing error handling ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**B) Add a shutdown hook to stop the daemon** — Register `process.on('SIGTERM')` / `process.on('exit')` to run `bd daemon stop` for all known repo paths.\n\n**C) Consider a file-based lock to prevent duplicate daemon starts** — Write a second PID file (e.g., `.beads/backend.pid`) containing the Node backend's own PID. On startup, if the file exists and that PID is alive, skip daemon management entirely (another backend instance is already managing it). This prevents the multiple-dev-server problem.\n\n### Files to modify\n\n- `packages/backend/src/services/beads.service.ts` — Main fix (A + B + C)\n- `packages/backend/src/index.ts` (or main entry) — Shutdown hook registration (B)\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\n- `startDaemonIfNeeded` runs `bd daemon stop` before starting a new daemon\n- Backend shutdown triggers `bd daemon stop` for all managed repos\n- After multiple backend restarts, only 1-2 bd daemon processes exist (not hundreds)\n- No process accumulation over a 30-minute dev session with file-watch restarts\n- Existing beads-related tests continue to pass","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"toddmedema@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-18T14:27:04.259914-08:00","created_by":"Todd Medema","updated_at":"2026-02-18T14:27:04.259914-08:00"}

{"id":"opensprint.dev-mzj1","title":"Fix: invokeClaudeCli spawns orphaned zombie processes","description":"## Problem\n\nThe `AgentClient.invokeClaudeCli()` method in `packages/backend/src/services/agent-client.ts` (line ~284) spawns Claude CLI processes using `exec()` with shell interpolation. These processes become orphans (reparented to PID 1) when the backend restarts, and are never cleaned up.\n\n### Evidence\n\nOn 2026-02-18 we found **43 identical zombie `claude` processes** in Activity Monitor (they show as \"2.1.42\" which is the Claude Code CLI version). All were stuck running the identical \"Planner agent\" prompt from `deploy-fix-epic.service.ts` with empty test output. They accumulated across multiple backend restarts.\n\n### Root Cause\n\n1. `invokeClaudeCli` uses `exec()` (line 284) which runs through a shell. When the parent Node process dies (tsx watch restart, crash), the shell may exit but the `claude` child process survives as an orphan to PID 1.\n2. There is no process group tracking — unlike `spawnWithTaskFile()` (which correctly uses `detached: true` and `-pid` group kill), `invokeClaudeCli` has no way to kill the full process tree.\n3. There is no backend shutdown hook to clean up spawned child processes.\n4. The prompt is passed as a shell argument via string interpolation, which is fragile and can cause hangs with special characters or empty input.\n\n### Fix Required\n\n**A) Refactor `invokeClaudeCli` to use `spawn` instead of `exec`** — This matches the pattern already used by `invokeCursorCli`/`runCursorAgentSpawn` (line ~407). Pass the prompt as a direct argv element, not through shell interpolation. This gives direct process control and avoids shell escaping issues.\n\nBefore (broken):\n```typescript\nconst child = exec(`claude ${modelArg} --print \"${fullPrompt.replace(/\"/g, '\\\\\"')}\"`, { ... });\n```\n\nAfter (fixed):\n```typescript\nconst args = ['--print', fullPrompt];\nif (config.model) args.unshift('--model', config.model);\nconst child = spawn('claude', args, {\n  cwd: options.cwd || process.cwd(),\n  stdio: ['ignore', 'pipe', 'pipe'],\n});\n```\n\n**B) Add a process registry and shutdown hook** — Track all spawned child PIDs in a Set. Register `process.on('SIGTERM')` and `process.on('SIGINT')` handlers in the backend entry point that kill all tracked children. Remove PIDs from the set on process exit.\n\n**C) Add a startup cleanup** — On backend startup, optionally kill any orphaned `claude --print` processes from previous runs (check for processes whose parent is PID 1 with matching command signature).\n\n### Files to modify\n\n- `packages/backend/src/services/agent-client.ts` — Main fix (A + B)\n- `packages/backend/src/index.ts` (or main entry) — Shutdown hook registration (B)\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\n- `invokeClaudeCli` uses `spawn` (not `exec`) to launch the claude CLI\n- Prompt is passed as an argv element, not shell-interpolated\n- All spawned agent processes are tracked and killed on backend shutdown\n- No orphaned claude processes remain after backend restart\n- Existing tests continue to pass","status":"in_progress","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","assignee":"agent-1","owner":"toddmedema@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-18T14:26:40.905111-08:00","created_by":"Todd Medema","updated_at":"2026-02-18T14:27:51.156196-08:00"}
