This includes the `current_phase` enum (spec/plan/execute/evaluate/deploy → deliver), deployment-related type names where they refer to the UI phase (e.g., DeployPhase → DeliverPhase), route constants, and WebSocket event prefixes (e.g., `deploy.failed` → `deliver.failed`). Do NOT rename references to standard deployment concepts (npm scripts, CI/CD pipeline terminology, Expo deploy commands, or the DeploymentRecord entity which describes an infrastructure action, not the UI phase). Acceptance criteria: all shared type definitions compile; grep for 'deploy' in enum/phase contexts returns zero hits; SPEED acronym references still resolve correctly (Spec, Plan, Execute, Evaluate, Deliver).",

Preserve backward compatibility if any persisted data uses the old name (e.g., migration or normalization of stored `current_phase` values).
