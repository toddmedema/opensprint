(Also show a browse icon and support the user uploading a .txt, .md, .docx, .pdf or .ppt). Once the user submits that initial prompt, show a thinking spinner with a few cheeky text strings rotating every 5 seconds (e.g. evaluating humanity, planning to take over the world) have an AI agent generate the initial content of the PRD and show the current edit screen.",
